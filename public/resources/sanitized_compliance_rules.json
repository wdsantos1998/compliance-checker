(v)  If the illustration covers the payout period for an investment, the illustration must reflect the impact of taxes during this period. (vi)  The illustration may not assume an unreasonable period of tax deferral. (vii)  The illustration must disclose, as applicable: a.  the degree of risk in the investment\u2019s assumed rate of return, including a statement that the assumed rate of return is not guaranteed; b.  the possible effects of investment losses on the relative advantage of the taxable versus the tax-deferred investments; c.  the extent to which tax rates on capital gains and dividends would affect the taxable investment\u2019s return; d.  the fact that ordinary income tax rates will apply to withdrawals from a tax-deferred investment; e.  its underlying assumptions; f.  the potential impact resulting from federal or state tax penalties (e.g., for early withdrawals or use on non-qualified expenses); and g.  that an investor should consider his or her current and anticipated investment horizon and income tax bracket when making an investment decision, as the illustration may not reflect these factors.

    "description": "2214 Requirements for the Use of Investment Analysis Tools (a)  General Considerations This Rule provides a limited exception to Rule 2210(d)(1)(F).  No member may imply that FINRA endorses or approves the use of any investment analysis tool or any recommendation based on such a tool.  A member that offers or intends to offer an investment analysis tool under this Rule (whether customers use the member\u2019s tool independently or with assistance from the member) must, within 10 business days of first use, (1) provide FINRA\u2019s Advertising Regulation Department (\u201cDepartment\u201d) access to the investment analysis tool and, (2) pursuant to Rule 2210(c)(3)(C), file with the Department any template for written reports produced by, or retail communications concerning, the tool. (b)  Definition For purposes of this Rule and any interpretation thereof, an \u201cinvestment analysis tool\u201d is an interactive technological tool that produces simulations and statistical analyses that present the likelihood of various investment outcomes if certain investments are made or certain investment strategies or styles are undertaken, thereby serving as an additional resource to investors in the evaluation of the potential risks and returns of investment choices. (c) Use of Investment Analysis Tools and Related Written Reports and Retail Communications A member may provide an investment analysis tool (whether customers use the member\u2019s tool independently or with assistance from the member), written reports indicating the results generated by such tool and related retail communications only if the tool, written report or related retail communication: (1)  describes the criteria and methodology used, including the investment analysis tool\u2019s limitations and key assumptions; (2) explains that results may vary with each use and over time; (3)  if applicable, describes the universe of investments considered in the analysis, explains how the tool determines which securities to select, discloses if the tool favors certain securities and, if so, explains the reason for the selectivity, and states that other investments not considered may have characteristics similar or superior to those being analyzed; and (4)  displays the following additional disclosure: \u201cIMPORTANT: The projections or other information generated by [name of investment analysis tool] regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results and are not guarantees of future results.\u201d (d)  Disclosures The disclosures and other required information discussed in paragraph (c) must be clear and prominent and must be in written (which may be electronic) narrative form. Supplementary Material: .01  Relationship to Rule 2210(d)(1)(F).  Rule 2210(d)(1)(F) states that \u201c[c]ommunications may not predict or project performance, imply that past performance will recur or make any exaggerated or unwarranted claim, opinion or forecast.\u201d  This Rule allows member firms to offer investment analysis tools (whether customers use the member\u2019s tool independently or with assistance from the member), written reports indicating the results generated by such tools and related retail communications in certain circumstances. Rule 2210(d)(1)(F) does not prohibit, and this Rule does not apply to, hypothetical illustrations of mathematical principles that do not predict or project the performance of an investment or investment strategy.

    "description": ".02  Advertising Regulation Department Requests.  A member subject to this Rule must provide any supplemental information requested by the Department.  The Department may require that the member modify the investment analysis tool, written- report template, or retail communication. The Department also may require that the member not offer or continue to offer or use the tool, written-report template, or retail communication until all changes specified by the Department have been made by the member. .03  Material Changes to Disclosures.  After the Department has reviewed the investment analysis tool, written-report template, or retail communication, a member must notify the Department and provide additional access to the tool and re-file any template, or retail communication if it makes a material change to the presentation of information or disclosures as required by paragraphs (c) and (d). .04  Investment Analysis Tools Used with Institutional Investors.  A member that offers an investment analysis tool exclusively to \u201cinstitutional investors,\u201d as defined in Rule 2210(a)(4), is not subject to the post-use access and filing requirement in paragraph (a) of this Rule if the communications relating to or produced by the tool meet the criteria for \u201cinstitutional communication,\u201d as defined in Rule 2210(a)(3). A member that intends to make the tool available to, or that intends to use the tool or any related report with, any \u201cretail investor,\u201d as defined in Rule 2210(a)(6) (such as an employee benefit plan participant or a retail broker-dealer customer), will be subject to the filing and access requirements, however. .05  Compliance with Other Applicable Laws and Rules.  As in all cases, a member\u2019s compliance with this Rule does not mean that the member is acting in conformity with other applicable laws and rules.  A member that offers an investment analysis tool under this Rule (whether customers use the member\u2019s tool independently or with assistance from the member) is responsible for ensuring that use of the investment analysis tool and all recommendations based on the investment analysis tool (whether made via the automated tool or a written report) comply, as applicable, with FINRA\u2019s suitability rule (Rule 2211), the other provisions of Rule 2210 (including, but not limited to, the principles of fair dealing and good faith, the prohibition on exaggerated, unwarranted or misleading statements or claims, and any other applicable filing requirements for retail communications), the federal securities laws (including, but not limited to, the antifraud provisions), the SEC rules (including, but not limited to, Securities Act Rule 156) and other FINRA rules. .06  Incidental References to Investment Analysis Tools.  A retail communication that contains only an incidental reference to an investment analysis tool (e.g., a brochure that merely mentions a member\u2019s tool as one of the services offered by the member) need not include the disclosures required by this Rule and would not need to be filed with the Department, unless otherwise required by the other provisions of Rule 2210.  A retail communication that refers to an investment analysis tool in more detail but does not provide access to the tool or the results generated by the tool must provide the disclosures required by paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(4), but may exclude the disclosures required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3). .07  Investment Analysis Tools that Favor Certain Securities.  The disclosure required by paragraph (c)(3) must indicate, among other things, whether the investment analysis tool searches, analyzes or in any way favors certain securities within the universe of securities considered based on revenue received by the member in connection with the sale of those securities or based on relationships or understandings between the member and the entity that created the investment analysis tool.  The disclosure also must indicate whether the investment analysis tool is limited to searching, analyzing or in any way favoring securities in which the member makes a market, serves as underwriter, or has any other direct or indirect interest.  Members are not required to provide a \u201cnegative\u201d disclosure (i.e., a disclosure indicating that the tool does not favor certain securities).

    "description": "2264 Margin Disclosure Statement (a) No member shall open a margin account, as specified in Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for or on behalf of a non-institutional customer, unless, prior to or at the time of opening the account, the member has furnished to the customer, individually, in paper or electronic form, and in a separate document (or contained by itself on a separate page as part of another document), the margin disclosure statement specified in this paragraph (a). In addition, any member that permits non-institutional customers either to open accounts online or to engage in transactions in securities online must post such margin disclosure statement on the member\u2019s Web site in a clear and conspicuous manner. Margin Disclosure Statement Your brokerage firm is furnishing this document to you to provide some basic facts about purchasing securities on margin, and to alert you to the risks involved with trading securities in a margin account. Before trading stocks in a margin account, you should carefully review the margin agreement provided by your firm. Consult your firm regarding any questions or concerns you may have with your margin accounts. When you purchase securities, you may pay for the securities in full or you may borrow part of the purchase price from your brokerage firm. If you choose to borrow funds from your firm, you will open a margin account with the firm. The securities purchased are the firm\u2019s collateral for the loan to you. If the securities in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, the firm can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held with the member, in order to maintain the required equity in the account. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following: You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account. A decline in the value of securities that are purchased on margin may require you to provide additional funds to the firm that has made the loan to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securities or assets in your account(s). The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). If the equity in your account falls below the maintenance margin requirements, or the firm\u2019s higher \u201chouse\u201d requirements, the firm can sell the securities or other assets in any of your accounts held at the firm to cover the margin deficiency. You also will be responsible for any short fall in the account after such a sale. The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. Some investors mistakenly believe that a firm must contact them for a margin call to be valid, and that the firm cannot liquidate securities or other assets in their accounts to meet the call unless the firm has contacted them first. This is not the case. Most firms will attempt to notify their customers of margin calls, but they are not required to do so. However, even if a firm has contacted a customer and provided a specific date by which the customer can meet a margin call, the firm can still take necessary steps to protect its financial interests, including immediately selling the securities without notice to the customer. You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. Because the securities are collateral for the margin loan, the firm has the right to decide which security to sell in order to protect its interests. ",

These changes in firm policy often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call. Your failure to satisfy the call may cause the member to liquidate or sell securities in your account(s). You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. While an extension of time to meet margin requirements may be available to customers under certain conditions, a customer does not have a right to the extension.

    "description": "2270 Day-Trading Risk Disclosure Statement (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), no member that is promoting a day-trading strategy, directly or indirectly, shall open an account for or on behalf of a non-institutional customer unless, prior to opening the account, the member has furnished to each customer, individually, in paper or electronic form, the disclosure statement specified in this paragraph (a). In addition, any member that is promoting a day-trading strategy, directly or indirectly, must post such disclosure statement on the member\u2019s Web site in a clear and conspicuous manner. Day-Trading Risk Disclosure Statement You should consider the following points before engaging in a day-trading strategy. For purposes of this notice, a \u201cday-trading strategy\u201d means an overall trading strategy characterized by the regular transmission by a customer of intra-day orders to effect both purchase and sale transactions in the same security or securities. Day trading can be extremely risky. Day trading generally is not appropriate for someone of limited resources and limited investment or trading experience and low risk tolerance. You should be prepared to lose all of the funds that you use for day trading. In particular, you should not fund day-trading activities with retirement savings, student loans, second mortgages, emergency funds, funds set aside for purposes such as education or home ownership, or funds required to meet your living expenses. Further, certain evidence indicates that an investment of less than $50,000 will significantly impair the ability of a day trader to make a profit. Of course, an investment of $50,000 or more will in no way guarantee success. Be cautious of claims of large profits from day trading. You should be wary of advertisements or other statements that emphasize the potential for large profits in day trading. Day trading can also lead to large and immediate financial losses. Day trading requires knowledge of securities markets. Day trading requires in-depth knowledge of the securities markets and trading techniques and strategies. In attempting to profit through day trading, you must compete with professional, licensed traders employed by securities firms. You should have appropriate experience before engaging in day trading. Day trading requires knowledge of a firm\u2019s operations. You should be familiar with a securities firm\u2019s business practices, including the operation of the firm\u2019s order execution systems and procedures. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position quickly at a reasonable price. This can occur, for example, when the market for a stock suddenly drops, or if trading is halted due to recent news events or unusual trading activity. The more volatile a stock is, the greater the likelihood that problems may be encountered in executing a transaction. In addition to normal market risks, you may experience losses due to system failures. Day trading will generate substantial commissions, even if the per trade cost is low. Day trading involves aggressive trading, and generally you will pay commissions on each trade. The total daily commissions that you pay on your trades will add to your losses or significantly reduce your earnings. For instance, assuming that a trade costs $16 and an average of 29 transactions are conducted per day, an investor would need to generate an annual profit of $111,360 just to cover commission expenses.

    "description": "Day trading on margin or short selling may result in losses beyond your initial investment. When you day trade with funds borrowed from a firm or someone else, you can lose more than the funds you originally placed at risk. A decline in the value of the securities that are purchased may require you to provide additional funds to the firm to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securities in your account. Short selling as part of your day-trading strategy also may lead to extraordinary losses, because you may have to purchase a stock at a very high price in order to cover a short position. Potential Registration Requirements. Persons providing investment advice for others or managing securities accounts for others may need to register as either an \u201cInvestment Adviser\u201d under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or as a \u201cBroker\u201d or \u201cDealer\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such activities may also trigger state registration requirements. (b) In lieu of providing the disclosure statement specified in paragraph (a), a member that is promoting a day-trading strategy may provide to the customer, individually, in paper or electronic form, prior to opening the account, and post on its Web site, an alternative disclosure statement, provided that: (1) The alternative disclosure statement shall be substantially similar to the disclosure statement specified in paragraph (a); and (2) The alternative disclosure statement shall be filed with FINRA\u2019s Advertising Department (Department) for review at least 10 days prior to use (or such shorter period as the Department may allow in particular circumstances) for approval and, if changes are recommended by FINRA, shall be withheld from use until any changes specified by FINRA have been made or, if expressly disapproved, until the alternative disclosure statement has been refiled for, and has received, FINRA approval.

Members should be aware that, in addition to general rules that may apply, FINRA has additional rules that specifically address day trading. See, e.g., Rule 2130 (Approval Procedures for Day-Trading Accounts); Rule 4210(f)(8)(B) (Margin Requirements) regarding special margin requirements for day trading. [Amended by SR-FINRA-2013-001 eff.
